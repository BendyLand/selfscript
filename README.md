# Selfscript

A self-contained, cross-platform, minimalist scripting language!

## About

The motivation for this project was to create a simple way to include a setup script with downloadable software in such a way that wouldn't require the end user to have anything installed. The entire language should be able to be bundled in with whatever software you're building, and it shouldn't increase the overall size but a substantial amount. My goal is to make it smaller than Lua.
